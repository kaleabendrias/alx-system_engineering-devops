# Project README - Networking Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

1. OSI Model
   - What it is
   - How many layers it has
   - How it is organized

2. LAN (Local Area Network)
   - Typical usage
   - Typical geographical size

3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
   - Typical usage
   - Typical geographical size

4. Internet
   - What it is

5. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
   - What is an IP address
   - What are the 2 types of IP address

6. localhost
   - Definition

7. Subnet
   - Definition

8. IPv6
   - Why IPv6 was created

9. TCP/UDP
   - What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
   - Main difference between TCP and UDP

10. Port
    - Definition
    - Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers

11. Device Connectivity
    - What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and copying someone else's work will result in removal from the program. Be sure to come up with solutions for the tasks on your own to meet the learning objectives.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Instructions

This project is aimed at helping you understand networking fundamentals. You are required to answer various questions related to OSI Model, LAN, WAN, Internet, IP Address, TCP/UDP, Ports, and Device Connectivity. The questions will test your knowledge of these concepts, and you should answer them without relying on external resources like Google.

For multiple-choice questions, simply type the number of the correct answer in your answer file and add a new line for each new answer.

Feel free to create Bash scripts to assist you in solving some of the tasks, but ensure they comply with the project requirements mentioned above.

Good luck with the project, and enjoy learning networking fundamentals!
