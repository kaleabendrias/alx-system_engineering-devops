## Instructions

This project focuses on networking basics and aims to help you understand some fundamental concepts related to networking on a Linux system. The learning objectives include understanding "localhost," "0.0.0.0," "/etc/hosts," and displaying active network interfaces on your machine.

You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives. Do not copy and paste someone else's work or publish any content from this project.

To complete the project, create executable Bash scripts that address each learning objective. Make sure your scripts adhere to the project requirements mentioned above and pass Shellcheck without errors.

Good luck with the project, and enjoy learning networking basics!
